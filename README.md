Work in progress!

This directory is a basic represenation of a planar Taylor Series expansion. Simply open up index.html in your browser.

Uses MathJax for formula formatting

- Build up a polynomial function.
- The polynimial function along with its Taylor expanded form will be drawn on a js canvas element.
- The expanded form will also be written out using MathJax

TODO

- needs better styling in general
- replace graph button with event listeners to graph in real time
- force input for 'r' to be non-negative
- add polynomial builder terms to memory and implement clear button
- function to graph a polynomial function
- function to get taylor expanded form
- update the math expressions in the DOM with event listeners

- add sine and cosine functionality (use a simple map for the derivatives)
